    "# RISK Probability Engine Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook documents my experiments in developing a probability engine for my Python-based RISK game replica.  \n",
    "The goal is to accurately estimate the probability of winning a battle given specific attacker/defender army counts, while keeping the computation **fast enough** to be used thousands of times during AI bot training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Approach: Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "My first attempt involved running **Monte Carlo simulations** for each probability estimate request:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process**: For given attacker and defender army counts, simulate thousands of battles to determine empirical win probabilities.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:  \n",
    "  - Easy to implement.  \n",
    "  - Accurate results with enough trials.  \n",
    "- **Drawbacks**:  \n",
    "  - Computationally expensive.  \n",
    "  - Even with optimizations, *single estimates* could take **1 second+** when using enough trials for reliability.\n",
    "  - Completely impractical when estimating **probabilities thousands of times** in a single bot training session.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking Results\n",
    "\n",
    "During benchmarking:\n",
    "- Average runtime for one estimate (with reasonable accuracy): **~1–1.5 seconds**\n",
    "- This meant **> 15 minutes** just to compute probabilities for 1,000 estimates — far too slow for real-time or large-scale AI simulations.\n",
    "- Not to mention for higher troop counts ($\\approx 100$), the runtime increases to over **1 minute** and scales **infinitely** beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Direction: Precomputed Probability Table\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the speed bottleneck, I decided to **precompute** the results of all possible attacker/defender configurations and store them in a **probability table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "- Run Monte Carlo simulations **once** for each `(num_attackers, num_defenders)` pair.\n",
    "- Save results in a lookup table.\n",
    "- During gameplay or AI decision-making, probabilities can be retrieved **almost instantly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "- **Speed**: Table lookups are effectively O(1) and take microseconds.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Same inputs yield the exact same probability, ensuring reproducibility.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works for both real-time play and large AI simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "- Memory trade-offs: storing probabilities for *all* combinations may require some compression if army counts get large.\n",
    "- Potential for using **analytical probability models** instead of simulation for even faster table generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating the table\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability table will be generated by systematically computing the win probability for **every relevant** `(attacker_armies, defender_armies)` pair using the existing `estimate_win_probability` Monte Carlo simulation method as the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points for choosing number of repetitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Monte Carlo estimate variance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When estimating a probability $p$ via $n$ independent trials, the estimate $\\hat{p}$ is a random variable with approximately a Binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{p} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p) / n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the **standard error** of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this, we can build a confidence interval around $\\hat{p}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\text{SE}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Choosing $n$ for desired margin of error:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to estimate $\\hat{p}$ to be within a margin of error $E$, rearrange:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\implies n = \\frac{z^2_{\\alpha/2}p(1-p)}{E^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, a margin of error of 0.5% (0.005) is precise enough to estimate the probability of winning. Since we are pre-computing the values, we can afford the luxury of waiting through more repetitions for a more accurate estimate. We *could* assume the worst case $p = 0.5$, which maximizes the variance $p(1-p)$, to get an upper bound for n:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n = \\frac{z^2_{0.05/2} \\times 0.5 \\times (1-0.5)}{0.005^2} \n",
    "\\approx \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\times 0.25}{0.000025} \n",
    "= \\boxed{38416}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For about 40,000 repetitions per estimate. But in reality, $p$ will not always equal $0.5$, and for extremely one-sided battles (say, 100 attackers vs 1 defender), we can expect a significantly lower variance as this is almost guaranteed a win. Thus, it may be worth running a mini-version of this function to get a pilot study estimate ($\\hat{p_0}$) to calculate a potentially much lower $n$ required simulations while still maintaining a precise margin of error. \n",

    "We never actually addressed the speed bottleneck, besides reducing the number of repetitions with attention to rigorous statistics. One of the main problems is that as troop counts get higher, the time it takes to simulate one battle increases (I expect the runtime scales linearly with troop counts, meaning 100 troops on each side = 100x longer to run). Once our table generator reaches the triple digits, we can expect significant pushback in its processing speed. Therefore, we could consider approximating a battle simulation by sampling from a normal distribution (see Random observations below).\n",

We send a large number number of attackers into an impossibly larger number of defenders, and observe the ratio of attackers lost to defenders lost. By the law of large numbers, we should asymptote to some ratio:"
