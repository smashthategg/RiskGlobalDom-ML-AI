# ML/AI Project for RISK: Global Domination 

Trying to make a bot capable of playing the game of RISK: Global Domination at a satisfactory level. 

Currently building a simplified Python implementation of the game.

## Features

- Map loading from JSON (supports continents, territories, neighbor links)
- Player and territory modeling
- Randomized territory assignment
- Initial army distribution
- Basic turn handling and attack/draft actions
- Event logging for game state transparency

> This project is a work-in-progress and currently does **not** include a full combat system, card trading, or user interface.

## Project Structure

risk_game # Full python implementation of RISK
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py # Entry point for running the game
â”œâ”€â”€ game.py # Game logic and game state definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ maploader.py # Loads map data from a JSON file
â”œâ”€â”€ structures.py # Contains data classes: Player, Territory, Continent
â”œâ”€â”€ map_data/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ classic.json # Map definition (territories, continents, neighbors)
README.md # You are here

## Quick Start

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smashthategg/RiskGlobalDom-ML-AI.git
   cd RiskGlobalDom-ML-AI
   ```

Run risk_game/main.py, and you should see a log of turns printed out.

## Map Format

Maps are defined in JSON and must include:

"territories": each with continent, neighbors (by name)

"continents": each with a bonus and list of territory names

Example snippet:

```json
{
    "territories": {
        "Alaska": {
            "continent": "North America",
            "neighbors": ["Northwest Territory", "Alberta"]
        }
    },
    "continents": {
        "North America": {
            "bonus": 5,
            "territories": ["Alaska", "Northwest Territory", "Alberta"]
        },
    }
}
```

## Future Plans

âœ… Player, Territory, and GameState structure

ðŸ”² Basic attack, draft, end turn logic

ðŸ”² Full combat rules and Card system

ðŸ”² AI bot(s) and training interface

ðŸ”² GUI or CLI interface
